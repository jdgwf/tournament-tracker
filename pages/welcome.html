		<div class="dev-note">
			<strong>What is done</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Modified my custom CSS app framework for Tournament Tracker (including multilanguage support)</li>
					<li>Added functions to add, edit, delete, import, and export players</li>
					<li>Added functions to add, edit, delete, import, and export tournaments</li>
					<li>"Start" a tournament. This includes setting up a grid - Simple Tournaments work well on a phone sized sreen.</li>
					<li>Handle scoring of tournament round in real time.</li>
				</ul>
			<strong>What is currently on the dev plate</strong>
			<ul>
					<li>Handle match-ups. Needs options for completely random, match pairs per ranking, and ability to attempt to avoid duplicate matches.
						<br />
						<br />
						This has been started and works (so far!). However, it's not checking to see if a player has had a bye or played another player yet.
					</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>What needs to be done</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Manual reordering of player matchups.</li>
					<li>Add "complete tournament" with a PDF export of the results.</li>
					<li>Filtering / Searching Players in both select and edit screens.</li>
					<li>testing, bugfixing, testing, and <strong>BUGFIXING</strong></li>
				</ul>
			<strong>What Might Be Done</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>I am likely going to combine the import/export functions because the tournaments import is highly dependent on the players data. This will likely go to the right-hand side menu by Settings.</li>
				</ul>
			<strong>Things on the far horizon</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a PDF 4-per-page Tournament Results handout for printing for the options set per tournament</li>
					<li>Timer, timed tournaments. Right now I assume that the Tourmament Manager will be handling this on his/her own device.</li>
