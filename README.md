#Tourmnent Tracker
##Purpose
Application for tracking and scoring various Miniature Wargame Tournaments

##Development
### Technology
This application is an Angular Javascript application that allows a user to create a BattleMech (and evenutually more!) from any device with access to a modern web browser.

The tools are powered by HTML, Foundation 6 and AngularJS. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by grunt via npm.

There are no server moving parts for the application itself, but I'm seeing a need for at least exporting of the data to and from the application itself between devices.
